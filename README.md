# airbnb-clone-project
## Overview
This is the backend for my Airbnb Clone project. It’s built to handle everything from user interactions and property listings to bookings and payments. The goal is to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb while keeping the system scalable and reliable for both users and hosts.

## 🏆 Project Goals

 **User Management**  
  Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

 **Property Management**  
  Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

 **Booking System**  
  Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

 **Payment Processing**  
  Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

 **Review System**  
  Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

 **Data Optimization**  
  Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

**Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

**PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

**GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

**Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

**Redis**: Used for caching and session management.

**Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
