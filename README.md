## 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines

## 🔧 What Are CI/CD Pipelines?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. These pipelines automate the process of:

- **Building** the application
- **Testing** it for bugs and issues
- **Deploying** it to production or staging environments

This automation ensures that new code changes are **quickly**, **reliably**, and **safely** integrated into the main codebase.

---

## 🎯 Why CI/CD is Important for This Project

- ✅ **Faster Development Cycles** – Automates testing and deployment, speeding up releases.
- ✅ **Higher Code Quality** – Runs tests and checks automatically to catch bugs early.
- ✅ **Improved Collaboration** – Teams can work on features simultaneously without breaking the app.
